          The great white shark (Carcharodon Carcharias), also known as the
          white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is a species of
          large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters
          of all the major oceans. It is notable for its size, with larger
          female individuals growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,905–2,268
          kg (4,200–5,000 lb) in weight at maturity. However, most are smaller;
          males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft), and females measure 4.6 to
          4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average. According to a 2014 study, the
          lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years
          or more, well above previous estimates, making it one of the longest
          lived cartilaginous fishes currently known. According to the same
          study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity,
          while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.
          Great white sharks can swim at speeds of 25 km/hr (16 mph) for short
          bursts and to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).
        </p>
        <p>
          The great white shark has no known natural predators other than, on
          very rare occasions, the killer whale. It is arguably the world's
          largest-known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary
          predators of marine mammals, up to the size of large baleen whales.
          This shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine
          animals, including fish, and seabirds. It is the only known surviving
          species of its genus Carcharodon, and is responsible for more recorded
          human bite incidents than any other shark.
